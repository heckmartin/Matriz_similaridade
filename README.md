### Dependecy:
 - **Plotly** (Required for the arc plot)
 - **Librosa** (Required for similarity matrix calculation)
 - **Numpy** (Required for the similarity matrix and for the repetition recognition)
 - **Jupyter notebook** (Optional, but recomended)

### Usage:
To generate the similarity matrix used to compute the repetition you will need to provide the path to an audio file.

Run ```Python Repetition_recognition.py <path to the desired track>```
